<h1>Eligibility</h1>

<b>Registration Interval</b>
    <br><li>Registration for both the <a href="#onlinereg">Online</a> and <a href="#onsitereg">Onsite</a> parts of PUPC-2014 will <b>open</b> at 00:00 EST Saturday, October 18, 2014 and will <b>close</b> at 00:00 EST Saturday, November 15, 2014. Any eligible individual may choose to compete in either one or both of the parts, subject to the conditions below. Please note that registration for each part is separate.

	<br><br>
<a name="onlinereg"></a>
<b>Online</b> <i>(to be completed at any location(s) convenient for team members)</i>
    <br><li>A full team will consist of anywhere between 2 and 6 members.
    <br><li>A team member must not have been enrolled full-time in a post-secondary institution before August 1, 2015.
    <br><li>All teams must register by the <b>earliest date</b> from among the following: (1) the registration closing date stated above, or (2) the date we reach 80 teams' registrations, at which time we will close registration. Because we cannot predict the rate of teams' registrations, <u>we recommend everyone to register as soon after the registration opening date stated above as possible if you seriously intend to compete</u>. (For reference, the current list of registered teams is available <a href="list.htm" target="_blank">here</a>. Please *refresh* that page any time you wish to see recent changes.)
    <br><li>No team can be added to the competition after the registration deadline, unless the current Director, Finance Chair, or Registration Chair of the Princeton University Physics Competition gives permission to do so.
    <br><li>Generally, teams are expected to come from single high schools, but teams comprising members from several schools will be allowed for their own convenience, in which case all high schools must be specified in the corresponding field on the registration form. <!--The current Director of the Princeton University Physics Competition will have the final word on the legitimacy of teams that do not come from an individual school.-->
	<br><li>There will be a single set of problems which participants in any grade of high school might attempt. In other words, a team may have members from different grades of high school, but the problems that they have to solve will be the same. Please specify the grade level of each team member next to their name in the registration form for logistical purposes.
    <br><br>
<a name="onsitereg"></a>
<b>Onsite</b> <i>(to be completed on Princeton University campus, in Jadwin Hall A10, on Nov. 22, 2014)</i>
    <br><li>Only individual contestants will be allowed to participate in the PUPC onsite session. Individuals must not have been enrolled full-time in a post-secondary institution before August 1, 2015 (i.e., this means you are currently a high school student).
    <br><li>All individuals must register by the <b>earliest date</b> from among the following: (1) the registration closing date stated above, or (2) the date we reach 100 individuals' registrations, at which time we will close registration. Because we cannot predict the rate of individuals' registrations, <u>we recommend everyone to register as soon after the registration opening date stated above as possible if you seriously intend to compete</u>. (For reference, the current list of registered individuals is available <a href="list.htm" target="_blank">here</a>. Please *refresh* that page any time you wish to see recent changes.) Please note that upon registration you are expected to arrive on site on the day of PUPC; if your availability changes later, please notify us <b>as soon as possible</b> by e-mailing psps@princeton.edu.
    <br><li>Each contestant is required to pay a small, $10 participation fee (to help cover expenses associated with holding the Onsite Test) <i>after</i> registration and <i>before</i> the competition, by means of <u>one</u> of the following:
	<br>&nbsp;(1) through the University's online "conference registration" system,
	<br>&nbsp;(2) by means of a check payable to Princeton Society of Physics Students and brought on site on Nov. 22, or
	<br>&nbsp;(3) by means of cash (no change, please) brought on site on Nov. 22.
	<br>For this fee <b><i>all</i></b> contestants will be treated to free lunch before the competition and will receive free T-shirts with PUPC logo/letterhead; everyone will also receive a personalized certificate of participation after the Onsite Test! Winners will additionally receive prizes in the form of medals.

	<br><br>
<b>Coordination with PUMaC</b>
    <br><li>For those who intend to compete in both the PUPC Onsite Test and the mathematics competition, PUMaC, please note that PUMaC will be holding a round for eligible finalists at the time of PUPC Onsite Test. If you also compete in PUMaC earlier in the day <u>and</u> are chosen as a PUMaC finalist, you will have an opportunity to take our 40-minute Short Version of the onsite test after your PUMaC event (please see <a href="http://physics.princeton.edu/pupc/other.htm" target="_blank">our schedule</a>). Hence, you should not worry about this matter. <!--Also, those who compete in PUPC and register with PUMaC should strive to eat lunch at PUMaC, for logistical purposes.-->
	<br><li>For everyone else, please note that the participation fee is non-refundable.

<h1>The Online Part</h1>

<b><u>Note:</u> The 2014 PUPC Online Part will be released by 00:30 am Eastern Time (UTC-5) on Saturday, November 15, 2014 both through e-mail and online at our <a href="https://piazza.com/princeton_university_physics_competition/spring2015/pupc" target="_blank">Piazza page</a>.</b>

<br>The Online Part is a way for PUPC to expose a team to what real physics is about: questions that may take more than an hour or two and require creative thinking for solutions.

<br>
<br><b><u>Rules: Online Part</u></b>

    <br><li>The Online Part will present interesting definitions or advanced concepts in two broad areas of physics.
    <br><li>The two subfields for the Online Part in the first year (2014) will be Condensed Matter and Cosmology.
    <br><li>The entire team may collaborate on this test. There is no rigid time limit, except teams must submit their solutions before the submission due date specified below. As such, the team will have approximately a week to work on the exam. Different teams may not collaborate with each other.
    <br><li>Teams may use any computational resources they might find helpful, such as Wolfram Alpha/Mathematica, Matlab, Excel, or lower level programming languages (C++, Java, Python, etc).
	<br><li>You may use written sources of information for reference, but you must cite each source you used in accordance with the <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/pr/pub/integrity/pages/cite" target="_blank">official policy</a> practiced at Princeton University.
    <br><li>Students will be required to submit written solutions with justification (proof-based, but not necessarily rigorous, unless specified).
    <br><li>Solutions should be sent to the address pupc.submit@gmail.com with your team ID in the Subject field. Only one person per team, identified as the "team manager" during registration, should send this e-mail. (Team managers will receive their team ID via e-mail before the Online Part is released.) Each submitted page should also have on it the team ID number and problem number, and the front page should include the signatures of <u>all</u> contestants in that team.
    <br><li>Although not necessary by any means, typed solutions are welcome. (For help with this, please refer to the LaTeX Wikibook.) Otherwise, please scan or take a high-resolution photo of each of your handwritten pages. In both cases, they should be uploaded as an attachment to your team's single e-mail message.
<br>
<br><b><u>Submission</u></b>

<br><li>Teams must submit their Online Part solutions by e-mailing pupc.submit@gmail.com in accordance with the Test Rules specified above by 11:59 pm Eastern Time (UTC-5) on Sunday, November 23, 2014. Teams would still be able to submit their solutions to the Online Part at a later time, but we cannot guarantee that they will be considered. <!--Any discrepancies will be dealt with by the current Director of PUPC.-->
<br><br>

<h1>The Onsite Test</h1>

<b> The 2014 PUPC Onsite Test will be held on Saturday, November 22, 2014. The schedule of events for that day and directions to campus are available <a href="other.htm">here</a>.</b>
<br>
<br><b><u>Rules: Onsite Test</u></b>
	<br><li>Each participant of PUPC will take one individual onsite test, which will contain three multi-part problems in two of the following subject areas: Mechanics (kinematics and dynamics), Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics, and Electromagnetism. The maximum score is 100 points, each problem weighs 30 points (with 10 free points given to everyone), and partial credit is awarded as appropriate.<!-- (OR ??? and the five questions are weighted as follows: 3-4-5-6-7 ???)-->
    <br><li>Participants are expected to record their answers on an official PUPC answer sheet.
    <br><li>Participants are NOT allowed to collaborate on this part of the competition.
    <br><li>Individual test will have a time limit of two hours.
<br><br>
<h1>Scoring</h1>

    <li>The Judging Committee will create separate rankings for the two parts of the competition: the Online and the Onsite parts.
	<br><li>In the case of a tie in the individual rankings, the advantage will be given to the participant solving the more difficult questions on the Onsite Part. If a tie persists, the participant with the more elegant solution will be given the advantage.
