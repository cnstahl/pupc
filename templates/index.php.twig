			The PUPC consists of two separate events: the individual-based Onsite Test, a written exam taken by contestants at Princeton University's Department of Physics and (starting in 2015) at international chapters, and the team-based Online Part, released to registered participants through e-mail and given one week to complete. The Online Part took place <b>November 9â€”15, 2015</b>. The Onsite Test was held on <b>November 21, 2015</b>.<br><br>Competition structure with guidelines and the inaugural year's (2014) problems can be viewed <b><a href="/2016/structure.htm" target="_blank">here</a></b>, and detailed competition rules for PUPC 2016 may be read <b><a href="/2016/rules.htm" target="_blank">here</a></b>. Interested competitors may register for either or both events, which have separate <b><a href="/2016/registration.htm" target="_blank">registration forms</a></b>.
